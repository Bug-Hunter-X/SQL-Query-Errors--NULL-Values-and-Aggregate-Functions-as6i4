The solution involves using functions such as ISNULL() or COALESCE() to handle NULL values effectively.  For example, instead of `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';`, use `SELECT AVG(ISNULL(salary, 0)) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';` This replaces NULL salary values with 0 before calculating the average. For comparing with NULL, use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`. For explicit type conversions, use CAST() or CONVERT(). Example: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE CAST(price AS DECIMAL(10,2)) > 100;` This ensures that the price is treated as a decimal before the comparison. In addition, always check your data types in the database schema.  Ensure data types in your query match the columns' data types.
