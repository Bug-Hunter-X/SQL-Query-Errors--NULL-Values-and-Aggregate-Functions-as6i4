In SQL, a common error is caused by incorrect handling of NULL values.  For example, comparing a column with NULL using the = operator will always return false, even if the column actually contains a NULL value.  This is because NULL represents the absence of a value, and it's not equal to anything, not even itself.  Another subtle error is related to aggregate functions.  When using functions like AVG(), SUM(), or COUNT() on columns containing NULLs, you might get unexpected results unless you handle NULLs appropriately using functions like ISNULL() or COALESCE(). Consider this query: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'; If some employees in the 'Sales' department have NULL salaries, the AVG() function will exclude those rows, potentially skewing the average.  Another issue arises with implicit type conversions. If you are comparing different data types in your WHERE clause without explicit casting, you might get unexpected results or errors.
