This repository demonstrates common SQL errors related to NULL values and aggregate functions. The `bug.sql` file contains queries that exhibit these issues.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides corrected versions of these queries, illustrating proper NULL handling and type conversion techniques.  The issues include incorrect comparison with NULL values and unexpected results from aggregate functions when dealing with NULLs.  The solutions show how to use ISNULL() or COALESCE() for NULL handling and explicit type casting for comparisons.  Understanding and addressing these issues is crucial for writing reliable and accurate SQL queries.
